# Illustrative Exercise: Stress Testing an Energy Company (Stanford ECON 101: Climate Finance Fall 2021)

This illustrative exercise is meant to help you get ideas for your own research project, and you can also use it as a basis for your own project, but is not obligatory (i.e. it does not count towards your grade).

## Step 1:

Read the motivations for conducting a climate stress test of a firm ([pdf link](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/pdfs/Motivation-for-Climate-Stress-Testing-Econ-101-Climate-Finance-Stanford-Fall-2021.pdf))

## Step 2:

Read the valuation model of the energy company ([pdf link](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/pdfs/Climate-Stress-Testing-an-Energy-Company-Illustrative-Valuation-Model-protected-3.pdf); download the file since it is password protected). The model is also simply described in words without formulas ([pdf link](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/pdfs/Climate-Stress-Testing-an-Energy-Company-Valuation-Model-in-Words-Protected.pdf); download the file since it is password protected).

## Step 3:

Read the illustrative exercise ([pdf link](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/pdfs/Illustrative-Excercise-Climate-Stress-Testing-an-Energy-Company-Climate-Finance-Course-Fall-2021-Stanford.pdf)).

## Step 4:

Answer the questions in the illustrative exercise by conducting a climate stress test of the energy company. Run the climate stress test by clicking on the ‘**Colab**’ button below.

## Step 5:

Organize your findings using the following structure (see also instructions in pdf link in step 3):
* Show and critically discuss findings on the core questions.
* Show and discuss findings on the transition & technology scenario questions.
* Discuss validity and ways to improve your energy company stress test.

## Notes:

* You do not need to look at the code to complete the exercise.
* You can fork the repo (i.e. copy the code) to adjust and/or extend it for your own research project, if you want to use this code as a basis.
* You can look at the [default parameters](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/default_parameters%20(read%20optionally).md) used for the model, but this is not necessary. You are also free to adjust the parameters for your own research project.
